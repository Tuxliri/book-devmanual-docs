## Where the documentation is

The documentation is broken down into a collection of books, with each book contained in a separate repository called `book-[name]`:

For example:

* [`book-devmanual-docs`](https://github.com/duckietown/book-devmanual-docs) (this book)
* [`book-opmanual-duckiebot`](https://github.com/duckietown/book-opmanual-duckiebot)

(documentation_format)=
## Documentation format

The documentation is written as a series of small files in Markdown format.

It is then processed by a series of scripts to create publication-quality PDF and an online HTML version.

You can find all these artifacts produced at the site [`https://docs.duckietown.com`](https://docs.duckietown.com).
