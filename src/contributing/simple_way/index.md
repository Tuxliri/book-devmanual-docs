# The simple way: Github

The simplest way to contribute to the documentation is to hover on the GitHub icon IMAGE_HERE at the top
the documentation page we want to edit, and then press "suggest edit" from the dropdown menu as shown
in the image below.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/step1.png
:name: fig:simple_way_1
:class: framed

Click on "suggest edit" button from the GitHub dropdown menu.
```

This will take you to the text editor on GitHub. One can make and commit the edits in only a few seconds.

If you are in the Duckietown organization, then you can edit the files directly and commit to a personal
branch for review (more on this later). If you are not a member of Duckietown, you will be asked to
fork the repository first, follow the instructions shown on GitHub to do so.

Let's proceed and perform our edits.

```

Once done, check the temporary outcome by clicking on `Preview changes`. 
Note that not all functionalities are visible by the preview. 
For significant changes to the documentation, refer to [](local-editor-workflow).

At the end of the webpage, use the form provided to describe your changes.
Start by choosing "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request", 
this will give you the opportunity to submit your changes for review before they go live. 
Then fill in the commit message and description fields
before confirming by clicking on the "Propose changes" button ({numref}`fig:simple_way_4`).
